# Optimization of Coffee Extraction Parameters and Evaluation of Regression Models

This code demonstrates the process of optimizing extraction parameters and evaluating multiple regression models using data related to coffee extraction. The data is loaded using `pandas`, and specific extraction parameters (e.g., dose (g), grind size, water temperature (C), etc.) are selected as features. Then, the data is split into training and test sets using train\*test\*split, and model optimization is performed using `GradientBoostingRegressor` and `MLPRegressor`. [Optuna](https://www.preferred.jp/ja/projects/optuna/) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters and search for the best parameters. Finally, the model's score is evaluated based on the test data, and the optimized parameters are output.
